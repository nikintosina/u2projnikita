LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
- private int x1, y1, x2, y2; - These variables represent the x and y coordinates of the two points.
- private double slope, yIntercept, distance; - These variables will store the slope, y-intercept, and distance between the two points.

Constructor
- public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
  - Initializes the instance variables with the provided coordinates.
  - Calls methods to calculate the slope, y-intercept, and distance.

Methods

private double calculateSlope()
  Calculates and returns the slope using the formula  (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).

private double calculateYIntercept()
  Calculates and returns the y-intercept using the formula y1 - slope * x1.

private double calculateDistance()
  Calculates and returns the distance between the two points using the distance formula.

public String getSlopeInterceptForm()
  Returns the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.


public String toString()
Returns a string representation of the LinearEquation object.

public String getCoordinateForX(double x)
Calculates the y value for the given x using the equation of the line and returns the coordinate in the format(x, y).
